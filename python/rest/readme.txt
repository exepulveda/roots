winframe.py: search for a windows frame that minimise the error w.r.t. its central frame
restore.py: agregate a set of images by register them and taking the median by pixel


Requires opencv

To install opencv I followed steps at
http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/
and it worked stringth forward on OS X. 

Standard installations should be followed for a different OS


To test methods set input and output paths in test_restore.py before run it.
